# PIM-Matrix-Compiler
 A specialized compiler that translates C++ matrix multiplication code into custom ISA instructions for DRAM-based Processing-in-Memory (PIM) architecture. This project implements a complete toolchain that analyzes matrix operations, identifies parallelizable loops, maps data to DRAM rows, and generates optimized instructions for LUT-based PIM execution.
